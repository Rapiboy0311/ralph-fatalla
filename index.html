                    <h1>What do computer programmers do?</h1>
                    <p>Writing and testing code for new programs. 
                        Computer programmers work closely with web and software developers to write code for new mobile applications or computer programs. 
                        In some cases, programmers might have a similar role to web designers, creating the look, feel and functionality of a new software program. 
                        Writing new code often involves a lot of trial and error. 
                        Computer programmers have strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and enjoy using logic to solve complex problems.</p>
